# Bootstrap-Forms

In Bootstrap, there are three types of form layouts:

-->  Vertical form (this is default)
-->  Horizontal form
-->  Inline form

****  Bootstrap Form Rules  ****
There are three standard rules for these 3 form layouts:

-->  Always use <form role="form"> (helps improve accessibility for people using screen readers)

-->  Wrap labels and form controls in <div class="form-group"> (needed for optimum spacing)

-->  Add class .form-control to all textual <input>, <textarea>, and <select> elements

wWe can apply validations on forms for better use.
